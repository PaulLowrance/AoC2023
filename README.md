# Advent of Code 2023

These are my attempts at the Advent of Code 2023 solutions in Rust ðŸ¦€.

## Running the Solutions

---

To run a day using the test input, run: `cargo run --bin dayX` where `X` is the day number.
To run the day against actual input, run: `cargo run --bin dayx -- --real` where `x` is the day number.

The runner will download the input automatically. Add the `AOC_SESSION` environment variable to set your session cookie using

```bash
export AOC_SESSION="your session cookie"
```
